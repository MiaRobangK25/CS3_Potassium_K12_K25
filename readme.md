## 4. Short Description
       Our website aims to help gather materials and introduce the *World of Debate* to our younger batches! As proud Invictus Debaters (PSHS-MC's own Speech & Debate Club), we wanted to make the process of learning how to debate and improving at it easier for everyone else. 

       With that being said, there are many different aspects to debate that YOU must know, which takes much time to find out for yourself. We want to use our CS3 Project to show you the beauty of debate, and gain your confidence even as a complete beginner to *Debate Land* in the Philippine Debate Circuit! 

-  `The world of debate, brought closer to you ;)`

## 5. Website Web Pages

1. **Home**
- This is where the SHORT DESCRIPTION will be added. 

2. **Introduction**
- For this section, we want to quickly introduce the visitor of our site to debate! Debate manifests in many different forms, is has most likely been a term used to refer to "educational discussions". What we aim to do in the introduction is...
> A. Explain what the Philippine Debate Circuit is like, especially because the two most popular formats used in this community is ASIAN PARLIAMENTARY (3v3) and BRITISH PARLIAMENTARY (2v2v2v2) with different formats. Basically, it is a team of 3 versus another 3-- or 4 teams made up of pairs in one debate. 

> B. We want to also explain what debate is like. There is a side FOR the motion, and a side AGAINST the motion. These sides are referred to as PROPOSITION/GOVERNMENT and OPPOSITION respectively. Both sides will also have a set amount of PREPARATION TIME (Prep Time) to create their case why they are FOR or AGAINST the motion.

> C. Each person/debater in the debate has 7 minutes and 15 minutes to speak! You're not required to fill up the entire 7 minutes and 15 seconds, but if you have a lot to say-- you can. For Asian Parliamentary as well, there is a REPLY speaker in the FLOW of the debate/round (which will be discussed in the 4th Web Page).

3. **Time Keeper** 
- Since everyone in the debate has to speak for a maximum time of 7 minutes and 15 minutes, it has become a problem for people how they will time their speech. Sometimes, some timers are too slow or difficult to keep on  when a debater is speaking. 
- This will also contain the ff. depending on the speakers preferences
> A. `A Timer (Countdown from 7 minutes & 15 seconds)` - 1st Option, if in the middle of a debaters speech they want to see how much time they have left

> B. `A Stopwatch` - 2nd Option, to see how long their speeches are (and figuring out how much time they have left themselves) or if they have certain time stamps when they want to say a certain part of their speech

4. **Speaker Roles** 
- This is where we aim to discuss in DEPTH the roles of the two formats, ASIAN PARLIAMENTARY and BRITISH PARLIAMENTARY. 
> A. For ASIAN PARLIAMENTARY, the flow will go as follows. We will also add the in-depth explanation of each role (as they differ from format to format).

> B. For BRITISH PARLIAMENTARY, the flow will go as follows. We will also add the in-depth explanation of each role (as they differ from format to format).

5. **Motion Analysis** 
- By the Introduction, we should have already introduced what a motion is. Here, in the Web Page-- we aim to cover in depth the different types of motions. All of these motions are different from each other, which is very important if you're a debater. You must learn how to analyze or understand motions, and the world they are painting/describing based on their wording. 
> A. `THBT` - This House Believes That...

> B. `THS & THO` - This House Supports/Opposes...

> C. `THR` - This House Regrets...

> D. `TH, as xyz, ...` - This House, as (insert an actor), ...

> E. `THP` - This House Predicts...

6. **Case Analysis**
- This is the last Web Page (as of right now), with active examples or samples of what a DEBATE case could look like (in general).
- Here, we aim to examine the different parts that are crucial if you want to win a debate-- or be as clear as possible in one. This is also the website page we hope to have the most visual cues or animations. This is to make it much more easier to understand when we can divide the sample "cases" into its' parts. 

> A. `Framing/Set-up` - This is a very crucial part, very much so to clear up the debate, and make sure everyone is taking about or debating on the same assumption of the motion. This is important, in the case the motion sets up the world for one side clearly-- but the other is unclear or not provided. 

> B. `Arguments` - This is where you insert all of the mechanisms/reasons, or PROOF why you should win-- or why you should support your team on side Proposition/Opposition. 

- `FLAG:` Most of the time, Case Analysis will be the most useful for beginner-level debates because the focus is generating the right ideas. This is also a very important web page for certain speaker roles, especially because there are certain roles assigned to delivering their teams' case as clear as possible. Although, there is a BURDEN for all members of the team to know how to make a case to be able to contribute & be on the same page. This also makes it so that the debaters are flexible-- even if they aren't a certain speaker role. 

## 6. JS Incorporation --> How it will be USED/FOUND
- To incorporate Javascript, we wanted to try to use it in several ways (or the best we way we could think of)...

> A. `Neatly Switching Tabs/Refreshing Content` - Mia (Amelia Robang) used this in one of her Graded Excercises, but this was mainly to ensure that all of the content in each website page are not in one continuous page only. This will make it so that if we want to incorporate animations & such-- it will be much easier to sort through the pages & how it will be done through JavaScript. 

> B. `Time Keeper` - The method inwhich we want to incorporate Javascript is specifically in this home page. We saw the timer Sir Roy made and use for his classes... and we were inspired (and want to learn how to do the same)!
