        <h1>Speaker Roles</h1>
        <p><b>In debate, there are two main formats, Asian & British Parliamentary</b></p>

        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">For AP ( Asian Parliamentary 3v3 )…</h1>
        <p>Think of the <b>PROCESS of making PANCAKES. </b>
            Each side, GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION, needs to make the <b><i>BEST set of pancakes</i></b>. </p>

            <h2 class="toggle">Prime Minister & Leader of Opposition</h2>
                <div class="toggle-content">
                    <p>
                        <b>JOB:</b> During preparation time, all of the ingredients (ideas) during this time are mixed and cooked into pancakes! <br><br>
                        The pancakes by the first speaker must be shown to be cooked, baked, and are indeed pancakes to the judge, for all the other toppings and add-ons for the pancakes! <br><br>
                        They have to set up the Debate, the basis for the rest of the round. This is where all of the arguments/main points must be clear when providing the support on your side. 

                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="toggle">Deputy Prime Minister & Deputy Leader of Opp.</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                    <p>
                        <b>JOB:</b> In the case that some of the pancakes are undercooked, not as well done as the first speaker, this is where the deputies come in! They can…<br><br>
                        <b> A: </b>Point out how undercooked the other teams’ pancakes are, RESPOND to the other team, make callouts, and take their pancakes down!<br><br>
                        <b> B: </b>Cook the undercooked pancakes, REBUILD their pancake tower by MORE IDEAS as to why the pancakes provided by the first speaker are still BETTER!<br><br>
                        <b> C: </b>Make more pancakes, different from the pancakes given by the first speaker! They can EXTEND and provide additional layers of analysis that are still important in supporting their side. 
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2 class="toggle">Government and Opposition Whip</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    <b> JOB: </b> At the whips, they are the ones who add special toppings to advertise their pancakes to the judge. <br><br>
                    They are the ones who summarize the debate, as to what their case is– to make it as clear as possible what they’re defending! <br><br>
                    They also get to respond to the other team, give more responses, and weigh in as to why their pancakes are better. As much as possible, the whips are the ones who will advertise their pancakes as the BEST ones. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle">Government Reply & Opposition Reply </h2>

                </p>
            </div>

            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">For BP ( British Parliamentary 2v2v2v2 )…</h1>
            <p>Each side of the <b>GOVERNMENT/PROPOSITION and OPPOSITION is split into two</b>. All of these positions in the debate will be <i>decided at random</i>!

                Each team of two will be assigned to… 
            <b>
                <li> OPENING GOVERNMENT (OG)</li>
                <li> CLOSING GOVERNMENT(CG)</li> 
                <li> OPENING OPPOSITION(OO)</li>
                <li> CLOSING GOVERNMENT(CG)</li>
            </b>

            <p>
                Think of BP as <b>each team of 2 at OG, OO, CG, and CO</b> is competing <b><i>to build the <u>BEST, MOST IMPORTANT (yet unique) BURGER–</u> that seems the tastiest</i></b> to the judge. 
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <h2 class="toggle">Prime Minister & Leader of Opposition</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    JOB: Build the BEST burger they can from their preparation time that defends their side.                  
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the specifics, they are the same as the ones from the Asian Parliamentary!          
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle">Deputy Prime Minister & Deputy Leader of Opposition</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    JOB: Build on and SELL the burger built from the 1st Speaker! Not only will they add onto this burger, but they must also sell it as early as deputy.                      
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the specifics, they are the same as the ones from the Asian Parliamentary!
                </p>

            <h2 class="toggle">Member of Government / Opposition </h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    JOB: Build a UNIQUE, DISTINCT Burger from their OPENING (OG/OO) for their side still.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basically, they will provide an EXTENSION at closing!  An extension can be a new argument, rebuttal, characterization, or analysis! As long as it increases their team’s persuasion, it can be considered as an EXTENSION, or a DISTINCT BURGER.        
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle">Government / Opposition Whip</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    JOB: Their job is similar to the deputies (2nd Speakers), as they also have to SELL their DISTINCT burger from MEMBER (MG/MO)! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the specifics, they are the same as the ones from the Asian Parliamentary! Although they cannot make new pancakes/burgers as explained above for the ASIAN PARLIAMENTARY format.
