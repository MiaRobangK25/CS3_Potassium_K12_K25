            <h2 class="toggle">1. The Most Popular Debate Formats</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    The Philippine Debate Circuit is <i>very competitive</i>. Debate is a <b>sport</b>, a sport a lot of people take seriously-- or find solace in. Yet, at the same time, debate is also very <b>flexible</b>! In the Philippine world of debate-- there are <b>two popular formats</b>. 
                    The first is <b><u>A] ASIAN PARLIAMENTARY (3v3)</u></b>, and <b><u>B] BRITISH PARLIAMENTARY (2v2v2v2)</u></b>. In a debate round (or room), it is made up of a team of <b>3 versus another team of 3</b> in Asian Parliamentary-- and for British Parliamentary, it is <b>4 teams made up of pairs</b> all competing for being 1st. 
                </p>

            <h2 class="toggle">2. Sides of a Debate, and Preparation Time</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    Aside from talking about the two formats in the Philippine Debate World, we want to also explain the <i>technicalities of debate</i>. There is a side <b>FOR the motion</b>, and a side <b>AGAINST the motion</b>. These sides are referred to as <b><u>PROPOSITION/GOVERNMENT (FOR)</u></b> and <b><u>OPPOSITION (AGAINST)</u></b> respectively. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both sides will also have a set amount of <b><u>PREPARATION TIME (Prep Time)</u> to create their case as to why they are FOR or AGAINST the motion</b>. These cases will be the <b>determining factor as who wins the debate</b>, which you can check out in one of the other pages in this website!
                    Before the debate round itself, the motion will be released-- and all teams will have a certain amount of time to prepare, then go straight into all of the speeches afterwards. 
                    In <b><u>ASIAN PARLIAMENTARY, both teams have 30 minutes to prepare</u></b> for their cases and speeches! As for <b><u>BRITISH PARLIAMENTARY, the 4 teams only have 15 minutes to prepare</u></b> for their speeches and the round. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle">3. Speeches and Speaker Positions</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    Each person/debater in the debate has <b><u>7 minutes and 15 minutes to speak</u></b>! You're not required to fill up the entire 7 minutes and 15 seconds, <i>but if you have a lot to say-- you can</i>. For Asian Parliamentary as well, there is a REPLY speaker in the FLOW of the debate/round (which will be discussed in the 4th Web Page), which will only speak for <b>a maximum of 4 minutes</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are also <b>different speaker positions for each debate format</b>>, and the speaker role/position still <i>depends on what position you and your team choose before the round</i>. <b><u>Each of these speaker positions have different goals/purposes</u></b>, and it really depends on <i>what ROLE best suits you</i>! 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle">4. Quick Overview of Motions</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    We've briefly explained this in 1., when we explained how some teams are <b><u>FOR/AGAINST the motion</u></b>! Although, there still so much left to talk about for <b><i>motions</i></b>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, since this is supposed to be a quick introduction/overview, 
                    what you need to know is that <b>debate motions can vary!</b> <b><u>All motions are worded in the format of "TH"</u></b>, which stands for <b><i>"THIS HOUSE"</i></b>. Some motions can be written in the form of <i>"THIS HOUSE REGRETS X"</i> for example, or <i>"THIS HOUSE, AS [PERSON]"</i>, with many more variants. For now, just remember-- <i>this house doesn't mean 
                        you're debating as a house...</i> <b><u>most motions are debating FOR/AGAINST the motion in terms of an observers' perspective</u></b>.
