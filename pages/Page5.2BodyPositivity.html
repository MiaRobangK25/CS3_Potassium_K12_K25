<ol>
    <li>
        What does the shift look like?
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Internally: Public figures rapidly losing weight</li>
            <li>
                Externally: Promoting weight-loss products and encouraging people to lose weight
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        The way they advocate for this is probably:
                        <ol>
                            <li>It’s healthy</li>
                            <li>It makes you pretty (quite on brand)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        What is the counternarrative?
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                Body positivity
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Loving people for who they are and how their body looks</li>

        Why people who don’t fit weight beauty standards deserve support on Gov
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                Why do people have a hard time losing weight?

                        <ol>
                            <li>Implication: People often have no control over whether they fit weight norms</li>

            <li>
                How do we support them on Gov? (Manifestation)

                            <li>These products don’t widely exist; visibility incentivizes creation</li>
