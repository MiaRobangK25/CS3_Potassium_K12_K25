        <h1>Additional Debate Resources</h1>
        <p>Here, we hope to add some <b>additional resources, files, links, and drills/activities</b> that may be <i>helpful</i> to beginner debaters!</p>
        <p>
            Often, we've had trouble <i>finding examples</i> or <b>showing people how to debate</b>-- because everyone has <b>their own distinct style and structure</b>. 
            Through this additional page, we hope to give people <i>more inspiration</i> or at the very least, <b>a better understanding of how different people debate</b>.

        <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>
                Websites such as <strong><i>debatedata.io</i></strong> and <strong>Calico Tabs</strong>
                provide large databases of past debate motions and competition statistics.
                These archives can be used for <i>extra practice</i> or <i>brainstorming cases</i>.

                <a href="https://debatedata.io/?dateFrom=1981&dateTo=2026" target="_blank"> Main Motions Reserve</a>

                Use these statistics and motions as a reference for BRITISH PARLIAMENTARY!

        <h2 class="toggle-btn">C. Additional YouTube Lectures</h2>
        <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>
                Video lectures can <i>help explain speaker roles, case building,
                    and motion analysis</i>. These are useful for <b>if you prefer
                    watching and listening</b> instead of reading text.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you want someone to explain how the 1st Speaker Position works, here is a lecture by Ben Bensali– a Philippine Debater!
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Cti4zMujw&list=PLWusynXgGaEj3_Q1Da1r-4NEM70f1jNA9&index=2" target="_blank"> 1st Speaker (PRIME MINISTER/LEADER OF OPPOSITION) </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                As for the 2nd Speaker (Deputy) Position, here’s a video from my GOAT– and our very own PSHS-MC graduate, Rivaldo Aquino! Please watch this video, Kuya Riv is cool… 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA7BqmoeL1Y&list=PLWusynXgGaEgHkA5Wa3EqDSfPe8FjVyJk" target="_blank"> 2nd Speaker (DEPUTIES) </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, you may refer to this for the 3rd Speaker Positions, for whips! This is also from a Philippine Debater! 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cmQsVWJpNA&list=PLWusynXgGaEhgS0AS-1-kagR75U1M29X8&index=2
                " target="_blank"> 3rd Speaker (WHIPS) </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The earlier 3 links were mainly for Asian Parliamentary, but they also apply to British Parliamentary! The only change is the addition of 
                Member speakers, which you can refer to in the video below.

        <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>
                This section will include <b>practice drills</b> and <b>activities</b> that
                debaters can do in their free time to <i>improve their skills</i>.

                <br/><br/>

                <b>1. Build your own CASES!</b> Of course, you time it like you're in an actual debate or competition-- with the pressure! You may also give the speeches after, just to get some practice in.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>2. For those interested Deputies, Members, and Whips-- Watch a debate round online or through recording, pause after a speaker, and give the next speech!</b>
                <br/><br/>
                <b>3. Speed Brainstorming Ideas for Several Motions</b>, this helps with idea generation on a time crunch as well-- in a time limit..
                <br/>
