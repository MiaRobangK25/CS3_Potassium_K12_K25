            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>This is a POLICY MOTION, based on whether or not we should implement/enact a certain policy.</p>
                <p>Usually, the one implementing the policy is the government unless stated otherwise.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle inline-toggle">This House Believes that X should...</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>This is a POLICY MOTION, whether or not X should do Y or a certain action.</p>
                <p>Government/Proposition teams can propose how Y would be done.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle inline-toggle">This House Believes That...</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    This is a VALUE JUDGEMENT MOTION, whether or not a statement is true. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not whether or not the government should do anything about the statement; it is about whether something is TRUE/FALSE.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle inline-toggle">This House Supports/Opposes...</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    In this motion type, teams will have to SUPPORT or OPPOSE X in the way it likely manifests in the world. 
                    Usually, these motions relate to one another. It is about supporting or opposing a certain idea in totality. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    EXAMPLE: If a GOVERNMENT team supports the idea that X will do more harm than good. The OPPOSITION has to oppose the idea, where they believe X has done more good than harm. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle inline-toggle">This House Prefers...</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    Teams must defend a specific comparison provided. 
                    This may be done in two ways: “This House Prefers X over Y,” with the opposition defending Y over X, or “This House Prefers X,” with the opposition defending the status quo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Opposition teams are burdened with defending their specific comparison and cannot defend something else or both (X & Y).
                </p>
            </div>

        </div>

        <!-- Right Column -->
        <div class="toggle-column">

            <h2 class="toggle inline-toggle">This House Would...</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    This is a POLICY MOTION on whether we should enact a certain policy, X. The one implementing/enacting said policy is the government/state, unless specified in the motion. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle inline-toggle">This House Prefers a world in which...</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    This is a UNIQUE type of THP motion. Government teams must defend the new world (world with X), while Opposition teams defend the status quo, or the world without X. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this motion, teams must still analyze the timeline as to how the world developed with X. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle inline-toggle">This House Regrets...</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    In this motion type, teams must argue whether a world absent X would be better than the status quo. Government teams must argue against the status quo (REGRETTING X). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Opposition teams can set up what they defend, as long as it follows the lines of “This house does not regret X,” for the following reasons they ought to provide. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="toggle inline-toggle">This House Predicts...</h2>
            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>
                    Teams must prove whether X will happen. It is not whether the object of prediction is good/preferable, but only whether it WILL happen. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way this motion type can be worded is “This House Believes That X will happen/occur”. 
                </p>
