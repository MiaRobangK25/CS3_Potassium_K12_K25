                                <li>On Side Opposition, you are more ignorant of your patterns -> Because you don’t think they are problems; you feel like they are “natural” and not negative</li>

                                <li>On Side Opposition, you don’t want to fix your problems</li>
                                <li>> You feel more focused on moving on, even when your problems haven’t been fixed yet</li>

                        <li>You look at people voicing out their problems as a little random, or at worst, a little OA about their problems</li>
                        <li>You feel like the solutions to their problems are quite easy to find because you feel like you yourself aren’t going through anything, so why the hell is it so hard for other people to not go through anything</li>
                        <li>People are forced to care about your problems</li>
                        <li>Even if people give a shit, its because they have to / they look like a bad person for not giving a shit</li>

                        <li>People will not go out of their way to help if it isn’t their own problem</li>
                        <li>Even if they do, its unsustainable because people won’t stick around; as long as they’ve done the bare minimum, that’s fine</li>
                        <li>The healing of marginalized communities gets worse</li>

                        <li>Things like racism affect you very deeply — you will still feel that problem even if you try to push it down</li>
