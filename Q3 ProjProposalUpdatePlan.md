# WDMotionNotionPotassiumFestejoRobang
> **By Pio Dominic Festejo (K12) and Amelia S. Robang (K25) of Batch 2029**

## Final Title : `Motion Notion`
- A catchy label that is easy to remember & understand the purpose of the website 

## Main Features of the Website 
> There will be **7 Pages in total**, with the addition of *one page*. 

*`FLAG: This website is data-heavy and full of information, but we hope to make it as digestable as possible!`*

### 1. **Home**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. 
> `MAIN ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - *Change in formatting*, most likely the addition of a photo or something else on the right side of this page. Content will stay the same. 

### 2. **Introduction**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. 
> `MAIN ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - Since all of the information and drop-down boxes have already been added, we hope to add some *animation* to make the transition of clicking the dropbox easier. 

### 3. **Timekeeper**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. 

> A.`MAIN ADDITION/S to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - *Change in formatting* of how people can use this page, and how the short description will be placed. 

> B. `MAIN ADDITION/S to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - We hope to make the *timer & stopwatch feature that will be provided fully functioning*. These can be set to different limits depending on their preference, using JavaScript. 

### 4. **Speaker Roles**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. 
> A. Speaker roles for both AP & BP debate formats will be explained

> B. Sample speeches can also be found here

> C. Debate formats will also be visible here

### 5. **Motion Analysis**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. 
> .

### 6. **Case Analysis**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. 
> A collection of different motions 
> Allows users to better understand applications of motion types

### 7. **`[Added Page]` Resources**
- Here, we hope to add some addition resources, files, and links that may be helpful to beginner debaters!
> Often, we've had trouble finding examples or showing people how to debate-- because everyone has their own distinct style and structure. Through this additional page, we hope to give people more inspiration or at the very least, a better understanding of how different people debate. 

- Specific details include...
> A. `Youtube Channels & Videos of DEBATE ROUNDS` - There are a lot of videos and youtube channels that post debate rounds, and it would be great if the beginner debaters/novices want to experience the flow of a debate through their posted recordings. 

> B. `Links for different Motions: debatedata.io; calico tabs` - These are usually the websites that have a large dataset of old motions, and statistics of different competitions. We hope that this archive of all the past motions can be used for additional practices, or if they want to think about all of the different motions (and their possible cases).

> C. `Additional Youtube Lectures` - This could be for the different speaker positions, how to build a case, or analyze motions. We acknowledge that sometimes reading the text in the website might not be enough-- so maybe video lectures might help instead! Instead of reading the text, they could watch a video and simply listen. 

> D. `Drill Ideas` - If we have any ideas for extra drills/activities they can do in their free time to practice debating, we hope to add them here!
