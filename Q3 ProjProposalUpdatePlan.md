# WDMotionNotionPotassiumFestejoRobang
> **By Pio Dominic Festejo (K12) and Amelia S. Robang (K25) of Batch 2029**

## Final Title : `Motion Notion`
- A catchy label that is easy to remember & understand the purpose of the website 

## Main Features of the Website 
> There will be **7 Pages in total**, with the addition of *one page*. 

*`FLAG: This website is data-heavy and full of information, but we hope to make it as digestable as possible!`*

### 1. **Home**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. This is the **MAIN PAGE** of our website. 
> `MAIN ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - *Change in formatting*, most likely the addition of a photo or something else on the right side of this page. Content will stay the same. 

### 2. **Introduction**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. This will be a short introduction of how to navigate all of the other pages, and additional context to debate world all beginners should know! 
> `MAIN ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - Since all of the information and drop-down boxes have already been added, we hope to add some *animation* to make the transition of clicking the dropbox easier. 

### 3. **Timekeeper**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. This will be where they can find a timer and a stopwatch feature, that can be adjusted depending on the time needed by the user. 

> A.`ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - *Change in formatting (HTML & CSS)* of how people can use this page, and how the short description will be placed. 

> B. `ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - We hope to make the *timer & stopwatch feature that will be provided fully functioning*. These can be set to different limits depending on their preference, using JavaScript. 

### 4. **Speaker Roles**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. This is where all of the other details and necessary information about the different roles debaters may have in a debate. 
> A.`ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - Since all of the information and drop-down boxes have also been added already, we hope to add some *animation* to make the transition of clicking the dropbox easier. 

> B.`ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - Adjusting the *formatting* of all of the information and photos, so that they flow much more smoothly when reading or checking the page out. 

### 5. **Motion Analysis**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. Here, we will still analyze all of the different motion types. 
> A. `ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - *Add all of the missing information*, especially from the descriptions of the motion types. 

> B. `ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - *Fix the formatting*, especially when all of the information will be displayed or clicked on 

> C. `ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - Once all of the information has been added, we hope to add some *animations* to add some flavor to the page!~ 

### 6. **Case Analysis**
- This will mainly stay the same as the Initial Project Proposal. We will still be using one of the example cases from one of our club sessions-- and a motion from a competition the Invictus Varsity recently had. 
> A. `ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - *Adjusting the formatting*, and the flow of the case from the top to the bottom

> B. `ADDITION to the TENTATIVE PAGE` - *Hovering animation* over some of the sections/parts of the case-- just so that it can help guide people through the case (and explain the structure & what is going on)

### 7. **`[Added Page]` Resources**
- Here, we hope to add some addition resources, files, and links that may be helpful to beginner debaters!
> Often, we've had trouble finding examples or showing people how to debate-- because everyone has their own distinct style and structure. Through this additional page, we hope to give people more inspiration or at the very least, a better understanding of how different people debate. 

- Specific details include...
> A. `Youtube Channels & Videos of DEBATE ROUNDS` - There are a lot of videos and youtube channels that post debate rounds, and it would be great if the beginner debaters/novices want to experience the flow of a debate through their posted recordings. 

> B. `Links for different Motions: debatedata.io; calico tabs` - These are usually the websites that have a large dataset of old motions, and statistics of different competitions. We hope that this archive of all the past motions can be used for additional practices, or if they want to think about all of the different motions (and their possible cases).

> C. `Additional Youtube Lectures` - This could be for the different speaker positions, how to build a case, or analyze motions. We acknowledge that sometimes reading the text in the website might not be enough-- so maybe video lectures might help instead! Instead of reading the text, they could watch a video and simply listen. 

> D. `Drill Ideas` - If we have any ideas for extra drills/activities they can do in their free time to practice debating, we hope to add them here!
    
## [RUBRIC] Definition of Done for the FINAL WEBSITE 

### 1. **All of the information is present**
- This applies especially for the pages that are information heavy. 
> Pages such as MOTION ANALYSIS, CASE ANALYSIS, and RESOURCES are the remaining pages that have missing/needed information or text. 

*`FLAG: The same goes for the rest of the pages, so we will double check once we submit our website again!`*

### 2. **All dropboxes, clickable features, animations should work**
- This means that all of the information should be accessible, and visible when interacted with. This includes any animations or other features (i.e. hovering over certain text). 

### 3. **The format/flow of the website (and its' content) should be coherent**
- There shouldn't be any information scattered about the website. It should be consistent for each page, and
